Here is my public SSH key in GitHub:<br>

Here it is on my `ieng6` account, in the directory:
![public SSH key on ieng6](lr3-github-public-key-dir.png)<br>
It's the file named `id_rsa_github.pub`.<br><br>
Here are the contents of my public key:

The `$` indicates that there is more text past the edge of the window, but it would be cumbersome to get the entire thing into one image.
## Private Key
Here is my private SSH key in on my `ieng6` account:<br>
![public SSH key on ieng6](lr3-github-public-key-dir.png)<br>
It's the file named `id_rsa_github`.
## Using `git` commands from `ieng6`
I added [this](https://github.com/Akhil841/cse-15l-lab-reports/blob/master/reports/lr3-commited-from-ieng6.md) file to the repository from `ieng6`.<br>
You can access it as a webpage [here!](lr3-commited-from-ieng6.md)
I first commited the file locally:
